# **Web Application for Personal Money Management**


### *_Scope_*

Developing a web application which allows the user to better manage their accounts and keep track of their finances.


### *_Description_*

This Web Application facilitates actions such as: synchronizing accounts, establishing monthly budgeting, tracking expenses and earnings and schedule bill payments.
The platform is based on a Single Page Application architecture. It is a responsive application being accessible on a desktop, mobile or tablet browser (depending on user preferences).


### *_(Minimal) Functionality_*

As a user, I can connect multiple bank accounts from as many financial institutions as I desire using their external API.

As a user, I can track everything which counts as an expense or income stream, based on a specific spending category, predict my monthly budget and log my recurring bills.

As a user I can choose to see the charts and reports (PDF, CSV) of my expenses based on categories. Nevertheless the application has an additional feature that allows me, the user, to forecast my spending behaviour.

As a user, I can set budget alerts and manage my savings in a recurring manner.
